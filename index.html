          The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than
          they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed decription of
          their ingredientshelp both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff
          member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that
          keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by
          ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and
          less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

          1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide themwith supporting computatitional devices.
          Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with
          manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps too provide accurate performance nd payroll data.
          <br>
          2.Economics, Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by
          putting an end to inaccurate time reporting , buddy punching, absenteeism, tardness, time abuse, and
          overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by AxsuimGroup found that large organisations save up to $1,600
          per employee after implementing automated attendance management system.
          <br>
          3.Productivity/Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and
          expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and
          overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administratition time with an automated system that
          does it all for you. From keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information to yor
          payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the se of resources
          which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility/Insights, Hassie
